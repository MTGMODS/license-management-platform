# MTG MODS platform

Micro-SaaS around a freemium digital product: identity, licenses, usage analytics, protected file delivery, public web app, Telegram and Discord adapters.

APIs talk over HTTP and RabbitMQ. Bots and license↔user stay on the **Docker network** (not through public nginx). The browser and Telegram Mini App still use `https://api.mtgmods.com` / `https://mtgmods.com`.

## Stack

Python 3.12, FastAPI, PostgreSQL 16 (one database per service), Redis 7.4, RabbitMQ 3.13, React 19 + Vite, Docker Compose.

## Run

Each unit has `.env.example`. Copy and align secrets **before** `up`:

```bash
cp services/user/.env.example services/user/.env
cp services/license/.env.example services/license/.env
cp services/usage/.env.example services/usage/.env
cp services/distribution/.env.example services/distribution/.env
cp bots/telegram/.env.example bots/telegram/.env
cp bots/discord/.env.example bots/discord/.env
```

Must match across files:

- `JWT_SECRET` — user + license
- `INTERNAL_SECRET_TOKEN` — user + license
- `BOT_SECRET_TOKEN` — license + both bots
- RabbitMQ user/password — license `.env` (broker) + `RABBITMQ_URL` in license, distribution, bots (`@rabbitmq`)

VIP template and obfuscator are **not** in git. On the server, overlay:

`services/distribution/app/builds/vip/` and `services/distribution/app/tools/`

then rebuild `distribution-service`.

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The Compose project name stays `mtgmods_backend` so existing Postgres volumes keep their names.

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| User | http://localhost:8001/health |
| License | http://localhost:8002/health |
| Usage | http://localhost:8003/health |
| Distribution | http://localhost:8005/health |
| Web | http://localhost:8080 |
| RabbitMQ UI | http://localhost:15672 |

OAuth redirect URIs for local compose use host port **8001**. Production callbacks: `https://api.mtgmods.com/v1/users/auth/...` (see comments in `services/user/.env.example`).

Bots call `http://license-service:8000/api/v1/license/...`. After switching from standalone bot containers, stop the old ones — two processes with the same Telegram token will fight.

`web` bakes `VITE_API_URL` at **image build** (default `https://api.mtgmods.com`). Override: `VITE_API_URL=... docker compose build web`.

## Local API without Docker

License and Usage use `REDIS_URL` (default `redis://redis:6379/0` in Compose).
For a locally installed Redis, use `redis://127.0.0.1:6379/0`.
Without Redis, public statistics are computed from the database on each request.

```bash
cd services/user   # or license / usage / distribution
python -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate   # Linux: source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env    # set DEBUG_MODE=True and SQLite URLs
fastapi dev main.py --port 8001
```

Ports: **8001 / 8002 / 8003 / 8005**. Vite for the SPA: `cd web && npm ci && npm run dev` (port 5173; optional `VITE_DEV_*_TARGET` in `web/.env.example`).

## Public statistics cache

License and Usage share Redis with separate keys:

- `mtgmods:license:public_stats:v2`
- `mtgmods:usage:public_stats:v1`

Both public endpoints return their statistics directly. Redis stores an internal
JSON envelope with `data` and `fresh_until`; this envelope is not exposed by the API.
`GET /api/v1/license/stats/public` contains only `updated_at` and `subscriptions`.
Legacy lifetime statistics are available separately at `GET /api/v1/license/stats/old`
as `{ "forever": { "overview": ..., "by_method": ..., "by_price": ... } }`.
The legacy endpoint reads the database on every request without Redis caching.
It reports paid, completed purchases for lifetime licenses still in the database;
deleting a license removes its purchase from these figures immediately.
Results are fresh for 5 minutes and retained for up to 24 hours. A request for
stale statistics returns the previous result immediately and schedules a refresh
in the serving FastAPI process, with a separate database session.

A per-key Redis lock coordinates both background refreshes and cold starts across
processes. The lock lasts 120 seconds; computation is limited to 90 seconds.
Publication and release check the owner's token atomically, so an old worker
cannot overwrite a newer result or release another worker's lock. If a process
dies, the lock expires and a later request retries the refresh.

On a cold cache, the lock owner computes the first response. Other requests wait
up to 4 seconds, then receive HTTP 503 with `Retry-After: 2` if data is still
unavailable. The web client has a 5-second stats timeout, so the first visit after
a cache reset can require a retry. Failed background refreshes preserve old data.
Redis connection/command timeouts are 0.5 seconds with no automatic retries;
when Redis is unavailable, statistics fall back to uncached DB reads. This keeps
the endpoint usable but can increase DB load during a Redis outage.

Redis has no published host port or configured persistence; restarting it clears
this rebuildable cache. API container restarts keep using the existing Redis data.
Health endpoints do not require Redis. There is no timer: refreshes are driven by
requests. Lifetime aggregates are excluded from the cached subscription query.
The license key is versioned as `v2` so previous combined responses are not reused.

Existing production deployment (PostgreSQL and the other services already running):

```bash
docker compose up -d redis
docker compose up -d --build --no-deps license-service usage-service
docker compose exec -T redis redis-cli ping
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8002/api/v1/license/stats/public
curl -fsS http://127.0.0.1:8003/api/v1/usage/stats/public
docker compose exec -T redis redis-cli --scan --pattern 'mtgmods:*:public_stats:v*'
```

The default Redis URL works with existing service `.env` files; set `REDIS_URL`
in both files only to override it. No database migration is needed.

## Automated tests

Regression tests cover all four backend services, both bots and the web client.
Python tests use isolated SQLite databases, temporary files, fakeredis with Lua
support and mocked external APIs; no production credentials or running Docker
are required. Install test dependencies in a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
python -m pytest tests -q
```

Web tests (HTTP/auth/session logic, API contracts and React route guards):

```bash
cd web
npm ci
npm test
```

See [tests/README.md](tests/README.md) for setup, per-component commands, covered
scenarios and explicit limitations. These tests do not replace live
PostgreSQL/RabbitMQ integration or real-browser end-to-end testing.
